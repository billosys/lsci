;;;; This inlcude wraps functions provided by the Python cmath module, which
;;;; in turn provide access to mathematical functions for complex numbers.
;;;; The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point numbers
;;;; or complex numbers as arguments. They will also accept any Python
;;;; object that has either a __complex__() or a __float__() method: these
;;;; methods are used to convert the object to a complex or floating-point
;;;; number, respectively, and the function is then applied to the result
;;;; of the conversion.
