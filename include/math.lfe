;;;; This inlcude wraps functions provided by the Python math module, which
;;;; in turn provide access to the mathematical functions defined by the
;;;; C standard.
;;;;
;;;; These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions
;;;; of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for
;;;; complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support
;;;; complex numbers and those which donâ€™t is made since most users do not
;;;; want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand
;;;; complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result
;;;; allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a
;;;; parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was
;;;; generated in the first place.
;;;;
;;;; The following functions are provided by this module. Except when
;;;; explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.
